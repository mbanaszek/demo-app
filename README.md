# GitHub Leaderboard

# Mix of NodeJS / ReactJS / Typescript / GraphQL / REST.

*Not so long ago in a valley there was a CTO of a company called LineSqueezr. One day, the
CTO had a brilliant idea: “Let’s create a leaderboard of committed lines per engineer.
Competition will definitely squeeze more lines from my folks!” - he said naively with an evil
laughter.*

Fortunately, Github has lovely REST and GraphQL APIs which can materialize this idea.

## What this application does.

The application produces a leaderboard for a Github repository for
a given URL. 

### `npm run build-dev`
